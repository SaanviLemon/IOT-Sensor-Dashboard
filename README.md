# IOT-Sensor-Dashboard
Full-stack IoT dashboard (Marchâ€“Aug 2025) built with a teammate to monitor real-time current and voltage. Arduino with ACS712 + voltage divider sends data via serial, parsed by a Node.js/Express backend and streamed with Socket.IO to a React dashboard for live visualization and control.
